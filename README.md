# Note Taker

## Description

This is an application designed to showcase the use of express in server controls with a UI. A JSON file is used in the backend to assist with the creation, deletion and viewing of saved note files.

## User Note Taker
On the home screen, you are presented with a button to advance to the note taking page.
Once you have advanced to the notes page, you are presented with a UI that displays saved notes on the left, and an area to view notes or edit new notes on the right.

If a saved note on the left is selected, it will appear on the right hand side to display the full contents of the note.

If the pen icon is selected on the top right, the note section and title section on the right will clear and can be edited.

Once a title and body has been filled out, a save icon will appear on the top right hand corner. This will save the note when selected.

To delete a note, select the trash can icon to the right of the note.

## Uses

This application is a quick, easy, and user friendly way to keep track of notes.

## Upcoming Updates
